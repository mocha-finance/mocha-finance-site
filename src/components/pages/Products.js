      <p className='products-text'>Many people think the answer to fixing this system is simple. Just put it all on DeFi. But in reality that doesn’t work by itself. The projects that have been successful in DeFi are the ones that do things that did not exist in old finance. Compound, Uniswap, Balancer are good examples. They all do things in a new way.</p>
